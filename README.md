# Species Sleuthing

## Overview

This project analyzes the Palmer Penguins dataset in Python to identify key features predictive of penguins' species and builds logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine (SVM) classification models to predict penguins' species with high accuracy.

## Key Feautures 

- Feature Selection: Applies systematic logistic regression-based feature selection to identify the trio combination of features
that are most predictive of penguin species
- Model Building: Develops logistic regression, random forest, and SVM classification models
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Uses cross-validated grid search to optimize model performance
- Visualization: Plots confusion matrices and decision regions to evaluate and compare model performance
 
## Contents

- species_sleuthing.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing all code for analysis, model building, hyperparameter tuning, and visualization
